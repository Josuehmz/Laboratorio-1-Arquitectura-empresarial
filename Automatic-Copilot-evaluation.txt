  AUTOMATIC COPILOT EVALUATION – TA GRADING REPORT
  Course: Digital Transformation and Enterprise Architecture
  Topic:  Stellar Luminosity – Linear and Polynomial Regression
===========================================================================

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This submission demonstrates a solid and well-organized implementation of
linear and polynomial regression from first principles. Both notebooks
cover all mandatory and recommended items: dataset definition, hypothesis
and loss function, analytical gradient derivation, non-vectorized and
vectorized gradient descent, cost surface visualization, learning-rate
experiments, feature engineering, model comparison (M1/M2/M3), interaction
cost analysis, and an inference example. The README provides detailed AWS
SageMaker execution evidence with multiple screenshots. The main technical
concern is that the inference cell in Notebook 2 applies the trained
weights (learned on normalized features) directly to raw, un-normalized
inputs, which would yield an incorrect prediction. Several markdown cells
also contain unfilled placeholder values ("X.XX"), suggesting the
documentation was not fully updated after execution.

GRADING BREAKDOWN (0.0 – 5.0 scale)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Repository Structure & Compliance ............................ 0.5 / 0.5
   - README.md present and detailed: YES
   - Two notebooks covering Part I and Part II: YES
     (01_part1_linreg_1feature.ipynb, 02_part2_polyreg.ipynb)
   - Datasets defined entirely inside notebooks (NumPy arrays): YES
   - Only allowed libraries used (numpy, matplotlib,
     mpl_toolkits.mplot3d): YES
   Deductions: None.

2. Notebook 1 – Linear Regression (One Feature) ................. 1.9 / 2.0
   - Dataset visualization (scatter + comments on non-linearity): YES
   - Hypothesis (L_hat = w*M + b) and MSE implementation: YES
   - Cost surface: 3-D surface + contour plot + explanation [MANDATORY]: YES
   - Analytical gradient derivation shown in LaTeX markdown: YES
   - Gradient descent – non-vectorized (explicit loop): YES
   - Gradient descent – vectorized (NumPy operations): YES
   - Convergence plot on log scale + textual discussion [MANDATORY]: YES
   - Learning-rate experiments with 3 values
     (lr=0.001, 0.01, 0.1) [MANDATORY]: YES
   - Final fit plot with per-point error lines: YES
   - Error discussion (systematic under/over-estimation explained): YES
   - Conceptual understanding of w (astro interpretation): YES
   - Limits of linearity discussed: YES
   Deductions:
   - (-0.1) Final fit visualization does not include a dedicated residual
     plot (error bar or residual subplot); error lines on the main plot and
     text discussion are present but a formal residual analysis would
     strengthen the evaluation.

3. Notebook 2 – Polynomial Regression (Two Features) ............ 1.7 / 2.0
   - Visualization with temperature color encoding: YES
   - Feature engineering [M, T, M², M·T]: YES
   - Normalization (z-score) implemented and applied during training: YES
   - Vectorized loss and gradients: YES
   - Training and convergence plot for all three models: YES
   - M1/M2/M3 feature-selection experiment [MANDATORY]: YES
   - Interaction cost analysis (w_MT sweep) [MANDATORY]: YES
   - Inference example with code and written interpretation [MANDATORY]: YES
   Deductions:
   - (-0.2) Critical bug in the inference cell (Cell 27): the new
     star's features are fed raw (un-normalized) into the model, but the
     learned weights w_M3 correspond to the normalized feature space.
     Correct inference requires applying the same z-score normalization
     (using mean_M3 / std_M3 from training) before calling predict().
     This produces an incorrect luminosity estimate at runtime.
   - (-0.1) Several markdown cells retain unfilled placeholder values
     ("L ≈ X.XX L⊙", "~X.XX" in the comparison table), indicating the
     documentation was not fully updated after the notebook was executed.

4. Cloud Execution Evidence (SageMaker) .......................... 0.5 / 0.5
   - Step-by-step description of SageMaker deployment: YES
   - Screenshots of SageMaker domain and Code Editor: YES
   - Screenshots showing notebooks loaded in SageMaker: YES
   - Screenshots of successful execution: YES
   - Screenshots showing at least one plot output: YES
     (GraficaData.png, Costo.png, GrafCost.png, end01.png,
      image01-04.png, end02.png)
   - Local vs. cloud comparison paragraph: YES
   Deductions: None.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
FINAL GRADE
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Repository structure & compliance :  0.5 / 0.5

                                       ----------
  Final grade: 4.6 / 5.0   [PASS]

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRENGTHS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Complete coverage of all mandatory items (cost surface, convergence plot,
  ≥3 learning-rate experiments, M1/M2/M3 comparison, w_MT sweep, inference).
- Well-structured, thoroughly commented code with clear docstrings on every
  function.
- Analytical gradient derivation presented in LaTeX, demonstrating
  mathematical understanding before coding.
- Both vectorized and non-vectorized implementations are correct and are
  verified against each other in a sanity-check cell.
- Normalization step correctly identified as necessary and properly
  implemented for training; the issue is limited to the inference stage.
- The SageMaker evidence is unusually thorough: many screenshots cover
  each major step from the domain panel through plot outputs in both
  notebooks.
- Conceptual discussion of astro-physical meaning of w and limits of
  linear models is accurate and appropriately detailed.
- Interaction cost analysis (w_MT sweep around optimum) is implemented
  correctly and interpreted well.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ISSUES & MISSING ELEMENTS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
- [Notebook 2 – Critical] Inference does not apply normalization to the
  new input before prediction. Line:
      X_new = build_features(np.array([M_new]), np.array([T_new]), ...)
      L_pred_new = predict(X_new, w_M3, b_M3)[0]
  Should normalize X_new using mean_M3 and std_M3 before calling predict().
  Fix: X_new_norm = (X_new - mean_M3) / std_M3; then predict(X_new_norm, ...).

- [Notebook 2 – Minor] The model-comparison summary table (Cell 21) and
  the inference interpretation cell (Cell 29) contain "~X.XX" and "X.XX"
  placeholders that were never replaced with actual computed values.

- [Notebook 1 – Minor] No dedicated residual/error subplot. The per-point
  error lines are helpful, but a bar chart or scatter of residuals vs. M
  would make the systematic bias more explicit.

- [Notebook 2 – Minor] The w_MT sweep range covers only ±0.01 around the
  trained optimal value, which may not illustrate the sensitivity of the
  cost to this parameter convincingly. A wider range would better
  demonstrate the parabolic shape of the cost curve.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TA FEEDBACK TO STUDENT
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great work overall. Your submission covers all required components and shows
strong mathematical and programming understanding. The most important issue
to fix is the normalization in the inference step of Notebook 2: the model
was trained on z-score normalized features, so any new input must go
through exactly the same transformation (using the training-set mean and
std, not recomputed from scratch) before being multiplied by the learned
weights. Without this step, the prediction output is not meaningful.

For Notebook 1, consider adding a dedicated residuals plot (residual vs. M
or a bar chart of errors) to make the systematic bias pattern visually
clearer, complementing your already good textual analysis.

For the documentation, make sure to re-run all markdown cells after
executing the code so that any placeholder values ("X.XX") are replaced
with the actual numbers. TA review focuses on substance, but unfilled
placeholders in interpretation cells suggest the analysis loop was
incomplete.

The SageMaker evidence is exemplary in detail. The local vs. cloud
comparison is concise and accurate.

AI-GENERATION ASSESSMENT  (INFORMATIONAL ONLY – DOES NOT AFFECT GRADE)
===========================================================================

A. Qualitative Assessment
--------------------------
Indicators consistent with AI assistance:
  - Extremely uniform code style and docstring format across all functions
    in both notebooks.
  - Explanations follow a textbook-like structure with consistent heading
    hierarchy and bullet-point breakdown, rarely deviating in tone.
  - Technical commentary (e.g., cost-surface explanation, convergence
    analysis) uses complete, polished sentences with little variation in
    depth or vocabulary—typical of generated prose.
  - Placeholder values ("X.XX") in Markdown cells suggest the narrative
    text was written before execution as a template, which is a common
    AI-assisted workflow pattern.
  - The README mirrors the notebook structure almost verbatim, suggesting
    both were produced in the same session from a shared template.

Indicators consistent with student involvement:
  - The normalization bug in the inference cell is an organic oversight
    that a fully AI-generated solution would typically avoid.
  - The choice of learning rates (0.001, 0.01, 0.1) and the specific
    w_MT sweep range are plausible student decisions.
  - The SageMaker screenshots are real execution artifacts that required
    manual steps.
  - The mention of a specific w ≈ 15.5 in the conceptual section suggests
    the student ran the notebook and read the output.

B. Quantitative Estimate
--------------------------
  Code:                 ~65% AI-assisted
  Explanations/markdown: ~75% AI-assisted
  README:               ~70% AI-assisted

C. Commentary
--------------
The codebase is clean, well-structured, and essentially correct, with a
style and uniformity that suggest significant AI tool assistance in both
drafting and polishing. The explanatory prose is notably consistent in
tone and academic register, with few idiosyncratic or informal observations
that would typically appear in student-written commentary. However, the
presence of a normalization bug in the inference step, specific numeric
references filled in from actual runs, and the real SageMaker screenshots
indicate active student engagement with the material.

This assessment is observational and does not imply misconduct.
